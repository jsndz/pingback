## **How it works**

Three simple steps to start collecting meaningful feedback:

### ➤ Share the link or embed the widget

Get a ready-to-use link or copy-paste a script tag into your docs, website, or app.

### ➤ Read & respond

All your feedback appears in your dashboard — filter, track, and respond in real-time.
